One-App is a framework developed by American Express for building modular, server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. It enables server-side capabilities by leveraging a combination of React, Node.js, and a modular architecture. Here's a high-level explanation of how it works under the hood:

1. Modular Architecture
One-App is built around the concept of "Holocubes" or "Modules." Each module is a self-contained React application with its own logic, components, and styles.
These modules are dynamically loaded and rendered on the server or client as needed, enabling code-splitting and modular development.
2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
One-App uses Node.js as the server runtime to render React components on the server.
When a request is made to the server, One-App resolves the appropriate module for the requested route and renders it to a string using React's renderToString method.
The rendered HTML is sent to the client, allowing the page to load quickly with content already visible, improving SEO and performance.
3. Universal JavaScript
One-App ensures that the same React components can run on both the server and the client. This is achieved by adhering to universal (or isomorphic) JavaScript principles.
After the server sends the initial HTML, the client-side React application "hydrates" the HTML, attaching event listeners and enabling interactivity.
4. Routing
One-App uses a centralized routing system to determine which module to load for a given route.
Routes are defined in the modules themselves, and One-App dynamically resolves and loads the correct module based on the incoming request.
5. Data Fetching
One-App supports server-side data fetching. Modules can define load functions that fetch data required for rendering.
These functions are executed on the server during SSR, ensuring that the rendered HTML includes the necessary data.
6. Module Federation
One-App uses a module federation-like approach to dynamically load modules at runtime. This allows teams to independently develop and deploy modules without affecting the entire application.
7. Configuration and Extensibility
One-App provides a robust configuration system for managing application settings, environment variables, and middleware.
Middleware can be added to handle custom server-side logic, such as authentication, logging, or API proxying.
8. Static Assets and Internationalization
One-App handles static assets like CSS and JavaScript bundles efficiently, ensuring they are served correctly to the client.
It also includes built-in support for internationalization (i18n), allowing modules to define translations and locale-specific content.
9. Error Handling and Monitoring
One-App includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that server-side errors do not crash the application.
It integrates with monitoring tools to track performance and errors in production.
By combining these features, One-App provides a scalable and modular framework for building React applications with server-side rendering capabilities. It abstracts much of the complexity of SSR and modular development, allowing developers to focus on building features.
